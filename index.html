            I'm a Business Analyst with vast hands-on developer experience, and I love diving into all sorts of tech stuff to make my main work easier and more productive. Over the long years of my work as both a developer and analyst, I've crafted plenty of such nifty tools. Understanding that I'm not The One, and that many others are doing the same or very similar job, but harder than me now, I've decided to share some of my tools to make their work easier, just as they have made smoother mine.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            These tools aren't intended to be sold as full-scale commercial products. However, I hope they'll earn some warm words from you. If you find any of my work valuable, and it makes your work life a little smoother, why not transform those warm words into a treat by buying me a couple-triple coffee cups on the <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/screeneroner" target="_blank">â˜• Buy me a coffee</a>? Your support means the world to me, and it's a delightful way for you to say thanks for the work I'm sharing.
        </p>

            Cheers!
